#Description: Create an application (Interest6) that calculates and displays compounded interest for an
#investment fo an inputted number of years.
#Prompts for original amount invested, annual interest rate, and number of years. Error-proof your code.
#Amount invested must be positive, interest rate greater than 0 and less than 25%, years invested greater
#than 0 and will be an integer.

invested = float(input("How much would you like to invest? ")) #invested input + error handling
while invested <= 0:
    print()
    print("Investment must be greater than 0.")
    print()
    invested = float(input("How much would you like to invest? "))

interest = (float(input("What is the annual interest rate? "))) #interest input + error handling
while interest <= 0 or interest > 25:
    print()
    print("Investment rate must be greater than 0 and less than 25%. ")
    print()
    interest = float(input("What is the annual interest rate? "))
interest = interest / 100 + 1

time = int(input("How long would you like to invest it? ")) #time input + error handling
while time <= 0:
    print()
    print("Time for investment must be greater than 0. ")
    print()
    time = int(input("How long would you like to invest? "))
print()

print("Year       Amount on Deposit") #chart printing
deposit = invested
print("0           " + str(deposit))
for i in range(time):
    deposit = deposit * interest
    print(str(i + 1) + "           " + str(deposit))
