#Program Description: Write an application (MaxMin4) that reads the input of five integers and
#determines and prints the largest , the smallest and the mean of the group.
#Use only the programming techniques that have been discussed in the class so far.
#Comment your code!

#inputs
firstNumber = int(input("Please enter in first number: "))
secondNumber = int(input("Please enter in second number: "))
thirdNumber = int(input("Please enter in third number: "))
fourthNumber = int(input("Please enter in fourth number: "))
fifthNumber = int(input("Please enter in fifth number: "))

#largest/smallest
largest = firstNumber
smallest = firstNumber

if secondNumber > largest:
    largest = secondNumber
elif secondNumber < smallest:
    smallest = secondNumber

if thirdNumber > largest:
    largest = thirdNumber
elif thirdNumber < smallest:
    smallest = thirdNumber

if fourthNumber > largest:
    largest = fourthNumber
elif fourthNumber < smallest:
    smallest = fourthNumber

if fifthNumber > largest:
    largest = fifthNumber
elif fifthNumber < smallest:
    smallest = fifthNumber

#output
print()
print("The largest number is: " + str(largest))
print("The smallest number is: " + str(smallest))
print("The mean of the 5 numbers is: " + str((firstNumber + secondNumber + thirdNumber + fourthNumber + fifthNumber) / 5)) #mean
