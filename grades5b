#Description: A Class of n students
#took a quiz.  The integer grades (0-100)
#are available to you.  Determine the
#class average using a while loop.
#Only programming techniques that have been 
#discussed in class may be used.

##set sum to zero
summ = 0

##set grade counter to one
gradeCounter = 1

##set totalStudents to the input value of the total number of students
totalStudents = int(input("How many students are in class? "))
print()
while totalStudents < 1 or totalStudents > 25:
    print("That is an unacceptable amount of students, enter 1-25. ")
    print()
    totalStudents = int(input("How many students are in class? "))
    print()

##While grade counters is less than or equal to totalStudents
while gradeCounter <= totalStudents:

    grade = float(input("Enter grade " + str(gradeCounter) + ": ")) #prompt user to enter the nth grade
    while grade < 0 or grade > 100: #check if grade is valid
        print()
        print("That is an unacceptable grade, enter 1-100. ")
        print()
        grade = float(input("Enter grade " + str(gradeCounter) + ": "))  # prompt user to enter the nth grade
    summ = summ + grade #add the grade into the total
    gradeCounter = gradeCounter + 1 #add one to the grade counter

##set the class average to the total divided by max
classAverage = summ / totalStudents

##print class average
print()
print("The class average is: " + str(classAverage))
